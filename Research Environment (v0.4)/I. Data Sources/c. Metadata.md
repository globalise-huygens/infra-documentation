tba - an overview of the different kinds of metadata we import and create ourselves. 

For example, metadata on:

page images
models (data sheets..)
htr (hyperparameters, but also training data..)
collections, documents, files
embeddings (which model, which parameters..)
concepts (which vocabularies, thesauri, ontology..)
reference data..

Or else, only choose to list here the classes of metadata with which a user can interact in the a) research portal, b) reference browser?
