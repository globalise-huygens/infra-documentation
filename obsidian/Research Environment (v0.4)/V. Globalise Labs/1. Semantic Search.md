There are a few ways we might think about this if we were to offer this to users in an interactive manner. The main distinction is between internal (supported) and external (unsupported) use. A second distinction is between a commercial, externally hosted and a (free), self-hosted service.

## Internal Use
#### Retrieval Augmented Generation 

Natural language queries are converted into embeddings which are then matched against embeddings of the Globalise corpus. A selection of the most appropriate (cosine similarity) texts are then passed on to a LLM for further analysis (i.e. on the basis of the original prompt). For an thoughtfully prepared demo of this in practice, which also includes an automatic evaluation by the LLM of the suggested texts, see:

#### Custom GPTs (Virtual Assistants)

We provide the necessary few-shot prompting to an LLM like ChatGPT and publish a link to a custom 'GPT' that has been fine-tuned to perform a certain task (for example, find and usefully represent, certain entities we'd not included in our own enrichment program). For an example of this (this requires a ChatGPT Plus account), see:

## External Use

#### API Gateway

In this scenario, we pass a transcription (page), or a document (pages), or set of pages or documents (e.g. search result..) to another service via its API and make it clear that by doing so, the user has left the research portal. For example, if someone wants to employ ChatGPT to turn the contents of a letter into rhymed verse, then that's fine, but this needs to happen outside the research portal, and at the user's own expense (e.g. they'll need to provide an API key).
