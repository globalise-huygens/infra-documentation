Link to HTR on EP

tba - more formal and detailed version of the below, also addressing the difference between the v1 and v2 transcriptions from Loghi.

We've now received v2 of the HTR transcriptions which (should) have slightly improved HTR, and now also include named layout regions. 

We've processed these to remove the embedded HTR hyper-parameters, added boilerplate licensing information, and also created plaintext versions, using the original reading order of the recognised paragraph (only?).

We're going to run some text next year to see if Transkribus does a better job at region detection, reading order, and (to a lesser degree) HTR. If so, we'll use our existing HTR (and to be built) layout classifier to determine which pages should be re-processed in Transkribus. 

Something we didn't include in the post-processing of the Loghi HTR was language detection. That's something that will need to be done (in some way) later (i.e. on a per page, region or some other granularity).
