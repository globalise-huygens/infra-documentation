Link to NA on EP

We're accessing these now via the NA's IIIF server. That mostly works, although we are seeing some latency issues, which in turn results in the Miradaor plugin not receiving all the image and metadata it needs fast enough, which in turn leads to the navigation and zoom buttons not rendering properly. We might, therefore, want to think about hosting the images locally at the HuC on our own IIIF server.
