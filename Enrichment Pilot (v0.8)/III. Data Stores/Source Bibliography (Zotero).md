We store the bibliographic references to the sources used for our structured data in Zotero.  ^55a05a

From Zotero, we convert this data into a LOD format and import it into GraphDB. This is currently a manual process. In theory, it should be possible to automate this via the Zotero API.

### status:

### pipelines:

- Input: manually
